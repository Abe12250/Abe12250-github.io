            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Hi, this is Abraham. I live in San Diego. I enjoy hiking and listening to Bach, and I sometimes play guitar when I’m bored. One of the reasons I became interested in Data Analytics is that I’ve been surrounded by IT engineers whose insights sparked my curiosity. To me, Data Analytics feels like a modern-day form of architecture. Originally, I wanted to become an architect to design houses and structures, but now I see Big Data and its applications as a way of understanding human beings and civilizations as a whole—like a living, breathing organism that is constantly moving, adapting, and interacting with its environment.

                To complete my assignment, I explored various data sets from the <a href="https://github.com/bulutyazilim/awesome-datascience" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 font-medium underline">awesome-datascience GitHub repository</a>.

                <span class="font-medium">Potential Applications and Values:</span> I have enjoyed MOOC-style learning courses which have a well-designed curriculum with self-pacing, video and audio lectures, an interactive learning environment, and student comments. This specialization on Coursera is a comprehensive data set of a learning curriculum that outlines the necessary steps and topics to gain a fundamental understanding of data science. The value lies in its structured format which can be used as a blueprint for learning and teaching data science concepts, and it's from a reputable source, Johns Hopkins University.
